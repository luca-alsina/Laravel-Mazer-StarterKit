## About this StarterKit

A mazer-based StarterKit for laravel who don't use any superficial or complex extensions.

This project aims to provide a solid and clean base for starting new projects requiring an administration panel. That's why this StarterKit will rely as much as possible on existing and reliable resources in order to start your project on a good basis.
